# GiphyExplorer
Explore the Giphy API in Swift

This app requires CocoaPods and the following cocoapods libraries:

* Kingfisher
* Alamofire
* SwiftyJson


After cloning the project to your system, simply open a Terminal window and change directory to the GiphyExplorer folder.  Follow by running the command:

pod install

This will create a GiphyExplorer workspace file.  The workspace file, GiphyExplorer.xcworkspace, is what you will want to open in order to build and run the project.
