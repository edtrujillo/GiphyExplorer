# GiphyExplorer
Explore the Giphy API in Swift

This app requires CocoaPods and the following cocoapods libraries:

Kingfisher
Alamofire
SwiftyJson

To install simply open a Terminal window and change directory to the GiphyExplorer folder.  Run the command

pod install

This will create a GiphyExplorer workspace file.  That is what you will want to open in order to build and run the project.
